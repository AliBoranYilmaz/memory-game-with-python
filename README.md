# memory-game-with-python  
In this game, the computer will give the user a random shape pattern, and after giving it, it will wait for the user to complete the same pattern completely and in the same order. The computer will increase the number of steps in the shape pattern by 1 at each step. If the user makes a mistake, the screen will flash 3 times and the computer will understand that the game has been reset. And it will continue to give a pattern of shapes from the beginning.

Note: For the project to work correctly, 'menu.py' file must be run.
